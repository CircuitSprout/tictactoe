            <h3>Hibachi Fried Rice</h3>
            <p>We've all been there. Well, at least I have. Any chance I've had the delight to dine at a hibachi restaurant, I'm excited to dive into their fried rice, tasting the notes of garlic and sesame oil. There just happens to be one problem. Being able to replicate the same recipe in the kitchen tends to be a hassle and regardless of the lengths gone to make it just right, there's always something missing; we try, we ask a friend, we even ask the chef, but it never seems to be just right. Thankfully that no longer is the issue and the following recipe will walk you through the best way to replicate that mouth-watering flavor captured in front of a seering grill. </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups of white rice</li>
                <li>2 cups of water</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of sesame oil</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of peas</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of carrots</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of green onions</li>
                <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by cooking the rice. In a medium saucepan (or prepare in a rice cooker with a 2 to 1 cup ratio), bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the rice and stir. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While the rice is cooking, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the peas and carrots and cook until they are tender.</li>
                    <li>Crack the eggs into the skillet and scramble them with the vegetables.</li>
                    <li>Once the eggs are cooked, add the cooked rice to the skillet. Add the soy sauce and green onions and stir until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Finally, add the garlic and sesame oil and stir until everything is well combined and heated through.</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and serve hot.</li>
